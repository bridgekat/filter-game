# Principal filters

The partial order defined in the previous world actually makes filters a
"semilattice". But proving this fact can be quite challenging! Before we enter
the semilattice world, let's train and upgrade ourselves by playing with a
special kind of filters.
-/

/--
The so-called "principal filter on a set `s`" is the collection of
all supersets of `s`.
-/
def Filter.principal (s : Set α) : Filter α :=
{ sets              := {t | s ⊆ t}
  univ_mem_sets     := by sorry
  superset_mem_sets := by sorry
  inter_mem_sets    := by sorry }

/-!
For convenience, we denote the principal filter on `s` as `𝓟 s`.

You can type `\MCP` (capitalisation matters) into Lean to produce this symbol.
-/

notation "𝓟" => Filter.principal

@[simp]
theorem Filter.mem_principal_def (s t : Set α) : s ∈ 𝓟 t ↔ t ⊆ s := by
  exact Iff.rfl

theorem Filter.mem_principal_self (s : Set α) : s ∈ 𝓟 s := by
  exact (mem_principal_def _ _).mpr subset_rfl

/--
A filter `f` is finer than the principal filter on `s` if and only if `s` is in
the sets of `f`.
-/
theorem Filter.le_principal_iff (s : Set α) (f : Filter α) : f ≤ 𝓟 s ↔ s ∈ f := by
  sorry

/--
The principal filter on `s` is finer than the principal filter on `t`
if and only if `s ⊆ t`.
-/
theorem Filter.principal_mono (s t : Set α) : 𝓟 s ≤ 𝓟 t ↔ s ⊆ t := by
  sorry

/--
The principal filter on `s` equals to the principal filter on `t`
if and only if `s = t`.
-/
@[simp]
theorem Filter.principal_eq_iff_eq (s t : Set α) : 𝓟 s = 𝓟 t ↔ s = t := by
  sorry

/-!
Next, we consider the coarsest and finest elements among filters.
The coarsest one, if exists, is called the "top" element or `⊤` (type `\top`
for the symbol). The finest one, if exists, is called the "bottom" element
or `⊥` (type `\bot`).

Our goal is to prove that they both exist: `⊤ = 𝓟 Set.univ` and `⊥ = 𝓟 ∅`.
Note that `⊤` only contains the whole set and `⊥` contains every subset.
(They are the same as the first two examples defined in the initial world!)

  bot_le := by
    sorry }

@[simp]
theorem Filter.mem_bot (s : Set α) : s ∈ (⊥ : Filter α) := by
  exact True.intro

/--
If filter `f` contains the empty set, then it must contains every subset,
and is therefore the finest (bottom) element.
